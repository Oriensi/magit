Magit v2.6.2 Release Notes (draft)
==================================

Fixes since v2.6.1
------------------

* When possible `git merge (--no-commit|--edit)' perform fast-forward
  merges, which isn't what one would expect.  `magit-merge-nocommit'
  and `magit-merge-editmsg' now works around that by always using
  `--no-ff'.

* The command `magit-log', when called with `--patch' but not
  `--graph', deleted the first two characters of file names in the
  diff.

* The default value for `magit-cygwin-mount-points' checked if
  "git.exe" was a cygwin flavor of git, instead of the (possibly user
  customized) value of `magit-git-executable'.
